# Privacy Policy

**Last updated and effective:** February 20, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how **Drew** ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, stores, and protects information when you use our Discord bot and related services (the "Services").

By using Drew, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

---

## 1) Data Controller

Drew is operated by its independent developer.

For questions or data-related requests, please contact us through the official support server.

---

## 2) Information We Collect

We collect only the data necessary to operate core bot functionality, including:

- Discord User IDs  
- Server (Guild) IDs  
- Channel IDs  
- Role IDs  
- Configuration settings and moderation preferences  
- Logs of moderation actions, including associated timestamps of related events  
- Command usage metadata necessary for functionality and reliability  

---

## 3) Message Content

Drew does not store message content unless explicitly required for moderation or security functionality enabled by a server administrator.

If such functionality is enabled, message data is processed strictly for moderation or security purposes.

---

## 4) Purpose of Data Processing

We process collected data strictly to:

- Provide and maintain Drew functionality  
- Store server configuration settings  
- Enable moderation and anti-nuke systems  
- Improve reliability and detect abuse  
- Diagnose technical issues  

We do not sell personal data.  
We do not share data with third parties for marketing purposes.

---

## 5) Legal Basis (Where Applicable)

Where applicable under data protection laws, data processing is based on:

- Legitimate interest in providing secure and reliable bot services  
- Performance of a service requested by server administrators  

---

## 6) Data Retention

We retain operational data only as long as necessary for functionality, security, and legitimate operational needs.

Data that is no longer required is deleted or anonymized where reasonably possible.

---

## 7) Data Security

We apply reasonable technical and organizational safeguards, including:

- Restricted system access  
- Controlled infrastructure access  
- Standard security practices to reduce unauthorized access risks  

While we take security seriously, no system can guarantee absolute protection.

---

## 8) Data Requests

You may request access to or deletion of data associated with your Discord account or server by contacting us through the support server.

We may require reasonable verification to confirm account or server ownership before processing such requests.

---

## 9) Policy Changes

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically.

When changes occur, the "Last updated and effective" date will be revised. Continued use of Drew constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
