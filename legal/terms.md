- Use Drew for unlawful, harmful, deceptive, or abusive purposes  
- Automate or spam commands in ways that degrade service quality  
- Attempt to bypass technical limitations, permissions, or security controls

Drew does not store message content unless explicitly required for moderation or security functionality enabled by a server administrator.

Termination may occur without prior notice.

## 6) Security Commitment and Limitation of Liability

Drew provides automated moderation and anti-nuke protection features designed to enhance server security.

While Stane makes reasonable and good-faith efforts to protect servers, Drew does not guarantee complete prevention of raids, nukes, account compromises, misconfigurations, or malicious activity.

Server owners remain fully responsible for proper role hierarchy, permissions, and overall server security.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Stane shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising from the use or inability to use the Services.

You use Drew at your own risk.

## 8) Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the country in which Stane operates, without regard to conflict of law principles.

---

## 9) Changes to These Terms

Stane may revise these Terms at any time.

When updated, the "Last updated and effective" date will be modified. Continued use of Drew constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
