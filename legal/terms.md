You are responsible for ensuring that members of your server use the Services appropriately.

You must not:

- Abuse, exploit, or interfere with Drew or related systems  
- Use Drew for unlawful, harmful, deceptive, or abusive purposes  
- Automate or spam commands in ways that degrade service quality  
- Attempt to bypass technical limitations, permissions, or security controls  
- Misrepresent Drew as your own service

## 3) Service Availability

Drew is provided on an **"as is"** and **"as available"** basis.

We aim to maintain reliable operation, but availability may be affected by:

- Scheduled or emergency maintenance  
- Infrastructure or hosting outages  
- Discord API disruptions  
- Technical issues beyond our reasonable control  

We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue features at any time, with or without notice.

## 4) Data Processing

Use of Drew is governed by our Privacy Policy.

Drew processes limited operational data necessary to provide moderation, security, configuration storage, and core functionality.

Drew does not store message content unless explicitly required for moderation or security functionality enabled by a server administrator.

---

## 5) Enforcement and Termination

We reserve the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate access to Drew, in whole or in part, at our sole discretion, including in cases of:

- Violation of these Terms  
- Abuse of functionality  
- Conduct that creates legal, operational, or security risk  

Termination may occur without prior notice.

## 6) Security Commitment and Limitation of Liability

Drew provides automated moderation and anti-nuke protection features designed to enhance server security.

While we make reasonable and good-faith efforts to protect servers, Drew does not guarantee complete prevention of:

- Raids  
- Nukes  
- Account compromises  
- Misconfigurations  
- Malicious activity  

Protection effectiveness may be impacted by:

- Service downtime  
- Insufficient permissions  
- Incorrect configuration  
- Discord API limitations  

Server owners remain fully responsible for proper role hierarchy, permissions, and overall server security.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Drew and its operators are not liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising from the use or inability to use the Services.

You use Drew at your own risk.

---

## 7) Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Drew and its operators from claims, damages, liabilities, losses, and expenses resulting from:

- Your use of the Services  
- Your violation of these Terms  
- Your violation of applicable laws or third-party rights  

---

## 8) Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with the applicable laws of the operator’s country of residence, without regard to conflict of law principles.

---

## 9) Changes to These Terms

We may revise these Terms at any time.

When updated, we will modify the "Last updated and effective" date. Continued use of Drew after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
