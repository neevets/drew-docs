# Terms of Service

**Last updated and effective:** February 20, 2026

By inviting or using **Drew** (the "Services") in any Discord server, you agree to these Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy.

If you do not agree, you must stop using the Services and remove Drew from your server.

---

## 1) Eligibility and Compliance

You agree to use Drew in compliance with:

- Discord Terms of Service
- Discord Community Guidelines
- All applicable local laws and regulations

You are responsible for ensuring your server members use the Services appropriately.

---

## 2) Acceptable Use

You must **not**:

- Abuse, exploit, or disrupt Drew or related systems
- Use Drew for unlawful, harmful, deceptive, or abusive activity
- Automate or spam commands in a way that degrades service quality
- Attempt to bypass limitations, permissions, or security controls
- Misrepresent Drew as your own service or plagiarize its features/content

---

## 3) Service Availability

We strive to provide a stable and reliable security experience.

Drew is provided on an **"as is"** and **"as available"** basis. While we aim to maintain high uptime and operational integrity, service availability may be affected by:

- Scheduled or emergency maintenance
- Infrastructure or hosting outages
- Discord API disruptions
- Technical errors beyond our reasonable control

We may modify, suspend, or discontinue features at any time, with or without notice.

---

## 4) Data Collection and Processing

Use of Drew is also governed by our Privacy Policy.

In order to provide functionality, moderation, and security services, Drew may collect and process limited operational data, including but not limited to:

- Server events (e.g., role changes, channel updates, member joins/leaves, moderation actions)
- User IDs
- Server IDs
- Role IDs
- Message IDs (where required for moderation functionality)
- Logs of moderation actions, including details and timestamps of related events
- Configuration settings related to security and moderation

Drew does **not** collect message content unless explicitly required for moderation, logging, or security functionality enabled by the server owner.

Data is processed solely for:

- Providing core bot functionality  
- Maintaining security and anti-nuke systems  
- Logging moderation actions  
- Ensuring service reliability and abuse prevention  

We do not sell user data.

Data retention periods may vary depending on operational and security needs.

---

## 5) Enforcement and Termination

We reserve the right to restrict or terminate access to Drew, in whole or in part, at our sole discretion, especially in cases of:

- Breach of these Terms
- Abuse of platform functionality
- Conduct that creates legal, operational, or security risk

Termination may occur without prior notice.

---

## 6) Security Commitment and Limitation of Liability

Drew provides automated moderation and anti-nuke protection features designed to enhance server security.

We will make reasonable and good-faith efforts to defend and protect servers using Drew, including actively monitoring and responding through automated security systems.

However, Drew does not guarantee complete prevention of raids, nukes, account compromises, misconfigurations, or other malicious activity.

Protection effectiveness may be affected by factors outside of our control, including but not limited to:

- Drew being offline due to maintenance, outages, or technical issues  
- Insufficient permissions or missing roles required for moderation actions  
- Incorrect server configuration  
- Discord API limitations or service disruptions  

Server owners remain fully responsible for:

- Proper role hierarchy and permission configuration  
- Maintaining appropriate security settings  
- Implementing additional safeguards where necessary  

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Drew and its operators are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages arising from use (or inability to use) the Services.

You use Drew at your own risk.

---

## 7) Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Drew and its operators from claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses resulting from:

- Your use of the Services
- Your violation of these Terms
- Your violation of applicable law or third-party rights

---

## 8) Changes to These Terms

We may revise these Terms at any time.

When updated, we will modify the "Last updated and effective" date shown above. Continued use of Drew after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
